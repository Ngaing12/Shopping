# ShoppingCartApp
This is a simple android shopping cart application. This app allows sellers to add products to their inventory, modify 
pre-existing products, and keep track of their total cost, revenue, and profit information. Buyers are able to browse the
inventory of all the sellers in the app, add/remove products in their shopping cart, and checkout the product(s) and have the cost
"charged" to the user's bill. Simple persistence is implemented using the internal storage of the android device. 

This project was an exercise in OOP design and is not intented to be a fully functional product.

Feel free to comment any suggests to improve the design if you like!
